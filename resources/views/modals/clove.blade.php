                                    Cloves are the flower buds of the clove tree, an evergreen also known as Syzygium aromaticum (1Trusted Source).

                                    Found in both whole and ground forms, this versatile spice can be used to season pot roasts, add flavor to hot beverages, and bring spicy warmth to cookies and cakes.

                                    You may know cloves as one of the main ingredients in gingerbread baked goods or a staple spice in Indian cuisine.

                                    Cloves are best known as a sweet and aromatic spice, but they have also been used in traditional medicine.

                                    In fact, animal studies have found that the compounds in cloves may have several health benefits, including supporting liver health and helping stabilize blood sugar levels (2Trusted Source, 3Trusted Source).

                                    This article reviews 8 of the most impressive health benefits of eating cloves.

                                    Cloves contain fiber, vitamins, and minerals, so using whole or ground cloves to add flavor to your food can provide some important nutrients.

                                    One teaspoon (2 grams) of ground cloves contains (4Trusted Source):

                                    Calories: 6
                                    Carbs: 1 gram
                                    Fiber: 1 gram
                                    Manganese: 55% of the Daily Value (DV)
                                    Vitamin K: 2% of the DV
                                    Manganese is an essential mineral for maintaining brain function and building strong bones (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).

                                    Apart from being a rich source of manganese, cloves are only used in small amounts and do not provide significant amounts of nutrients.
